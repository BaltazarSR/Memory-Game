# Memory-Game

Overview
This is a simple Memory Game implemented in Python. The goal of the game is to find matching pairs of cards within a grid. The game tracks the player's attempts and time taken to complete the game.

Features
Grid-based game board: Cards are arranged in a grid, and players reveal two cards at a time.
Matching pairs: Players must remember the positions of the cards and match all pairs to win.
Move tracking: The number of moves made by the player is tracked.
Customizable grid size: The game can be customized for different difficulty levels by changing the grid size.
How to Play
Start the Game: Run the Python script to start the game.
Reveal Cards: Select two cards to reveal. If they match, they remain face-up. If not, they are hidden again.
Match All Pairs: Keep matching pairs until all cards are revealed.
Win Condition: The game ends when all pairs are matched.
