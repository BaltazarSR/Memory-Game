# Memory Game

## Overview

This is a simple **Memory Game** implemented in Python. The goal of the game is to find matching pairs of cards within a grid. The game tracks the player's attempts to complete the game. 

## Features

- **Grid-based game board**: Cards are arranged in a grid, and players reveal two cards at a time.
- **Matching pairs**: Players must remember the positions of the cards and match all pairs to win.
- **Move tracking**: The number of moves made by the player is tracked.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the Python script to start the game.
2. **Reveal Cards**: Select two cards to reveal. If they match, they remain face-up. If not, they are hidden again.
